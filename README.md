## 🌳 About the Project
BookEnStub is a quirky, innovative booking system that lets users reserve a stump for some quality hammering time. This project is divided into four key applications:

1. <a name="restfulapi"></a>**RestfulApi**
   - Built with ASP.NET Core 6.
   - Handles all stump-related transactions.
   - Powers both the user and admin interfaces.
2. <a name="testproject"></a>**TestProject**
   - Ensures quality and reliability using NUnit.
   - Tests every part of our solution rigorously.
   - Keeps everything running smoothly.
3. <a name="webapplicationmvc"></a>**WebApplicationMVC**
   - A user interface for booking stumps, built with ASP.NET Core 6.
   - Sleek, easy to use, and stump-tastic!
4. <a name="winformsapp"></a>**WinFormsApp**
   - A C# Windows Form Application for the admins.
   - Manage bookings, create new ones, change existing bookings, and delete them.

## 🔧 Getting Started
Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Nuuurf/BookEnStubDK.git
```
Open the solution file `BookEnStub.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.
Set the `RestfulApi` as the startup project and run it to start the API.
Run the `WebApplicationMVC` for the user interface or the `WinFormsApp` for admin access.
Use the `TestProject` to run the tests and ensure everything is in tip-top stump condition.

## ✅ Testing
To run the tests, simply open the Test Explorer in Visual Studio, select the TestProject, and hit "Run All Tests". Watch as our test suite ensures that every aspect of our solution is as reliable as a stump.

## 📝 Development Methodology
We are embracing the agile life with Scrum, conducting sprints, stand-ups, and all those fancy agile ceremonies. Our board is filled with user stories that are more exciting than a fresh stump ready for hammering.

## 😆 A Note on Humor
Remember, this is an internal joke and a fun learning experience. Don't be surprised if you find puns, jokes, or references to stumps that make you question our sanity. It's all part of the fun!

## ❓ Need Help?
Stumped on how to proceed? Fear not! Open an issue, and we'll help you out as soon as we're done with our current stump session.

## 👏 Credits
BookEnStub is brought to you by a team of enthusiastic stump fans, also known as Computer Science AP students in their 3rd semester. We're living proof that you can create a masterpiece while having a laugh!
