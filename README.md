BookEnStub: The Ultimate Stump Booking System
Welcome to BookEnStub, the most groundbreaking stump booking system you've never heard of! Crafted meticulously by a team of highly qualified Computer Science AP students in their 3rd semester, this project is a delightful mixture of expertise, humor, and a profound love for stumps. Yes, you read it right - we book stumps here!

:deciduous_tree: About the Project
Have you ever found yourself thinking, "I wish I could hammer nails into a stump today"? Well, your bizarre dreams are about to come true! BookEnStub is a quirky, innovative booking system that lets users reserve a stump of their choice for some quality hammering time. This project is divided into four key applications:

1. RestfulApi
Built with ASP.NET Core 6, this RESTful API is the backbone of our booking system. It handles all the stump-related transactions and makes sure your booking experience is as smooth as a polished stump.

2. TestProject
We believe in quality and reliability, just like a good, sturdy stump. Our NUnit testing project ensures that every part of our solution is tested rigorously, making sure that everything runs as smoothly as a hammer hitting a stump.

3. WebApplicationMVC
For our beloved users, we've crafted a sleek Web Application MVC running on ASP.NET Core 6. This is your gateway to the world of stump booking, where you can choose, book, and fantasize about your stump.

4. WinFormsApp
And for the stump masters (aka admins), we've got a C# Windows Form Application. This powerful tool lets the chosen ones view all bookings, create new bookings, modify existing ones, and even cancel them if a stump needs a break.

:hammer: How to Hammer... I Mean, Run the Project
Clone this repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BookEnStub.git
Open the solution file BookEnStub.sln in Visual Studio 2022.
Set the RestfulApi as the startup project and run it to start the API.
Run the WebApplicationMVC for the user interface or the WinFormsApp for admin access.
Use the TestProject to run the tests and ensure everything is in tip-top stump condition.
:white_check_mark: Testing
To run the tests, simply open the Test Explorer in Visual Studio, select the TestProject, and hit "Run All Tests". Watch as our test suite ensures that every aspect of our solution is as reliable as a stump.

:pencil2: Development Methodology
We are embracing the agile life with Scrum, conducting sprints, stand-ups, and all those fancy agile ceremonies. Our board is filled with user stories that are more exciting than a fresh stump ready for hammering.

:laughing: A Note on Humor
Remember, this is an internal joke and a fun learning experience. Don't be surprised if you find puns, jokes, or references to stumps that make you question our sanity. It's all part of the fun!

:question: Need Help?
Stumped on how to proceed? Fear not! Open an issue, and we'll help you out as soon as we're done with our current stump session.
